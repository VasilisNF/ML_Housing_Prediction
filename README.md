# ML_Housing_Prediction
This Project is about an Oracle chatbot that predicts the future. The Oracle will use machine learning to do time series forecasting on housing prices. The chatbot will run on a server that will be connected with a client. The client will ask for a house price by providing specific details such as the number of floors and the server will reply with the predicted price. This project is divided into four different parts. The first section focuses on data exploration and processing. The Neural Network is built and trained in the second part. The third section is about evaluating test data, and the fourth and final section is concerning server-client communication.
